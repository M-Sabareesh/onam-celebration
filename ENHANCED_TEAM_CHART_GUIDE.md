# Enhanced Team Progress Chart Implementation Guide

## Overview
The leaderboard now features an enhanced line chart that displays team progress over time with distinct colors for each team, proper axis labels, and cumulative scoring visualization.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Distinct Team Colors
Each team now has a unique, vibrant color scheme:
- **Malapuram**: Bright Red (#E53E3E) with darker red border (#C53030)
- **Pathanamthitta**: Blue (#3182CE) with darker blue border (#2C5282)
- **Ernakulam**: Golden Orange (#D69E2E) with darker orange border (#B7791F)
- **Thiruvananthapuram**: Green (#38A169) with darker green border (#2F855A)
- **Unassigned**: Purple (#805AD5) with darker purple border (#6B46C1)

### 2. Proper Axis Configuration
- **X-Axis**: "Events Timeline" - Shows progression through events
- **Y-Axis**: "Total Points (Cumulative)" - Shows cumulative points earned
- Enhanced grid lines and professional styling

### 3. Cumulative Scoring Display
The chart now shows cumulative scores (running totals) rather than individual event scores, making it easier to track overall team progress.

### 4. Enhanced Visual Features
- Larger chart height (450px) for better visibility
- Thicker lines (4px) and larger points (7px radius) for clarity
- Enhanced hover effects with 10px hover radius
- Professional tooltips with formatted point values
- Smooth animations with 2.5-second duration

### 5. Interactive Elements
- Hover effects that change cursor to pointer
- Detailed tooltips showing team name and exact point values
- Legend with circle point styles for better identification

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (views.py)
```python
def get_team_progress_data(self, team_data):
    # Enhanced team colors with primary and border variants
    team_colors = {...}
    team_border_colors = {...}
    
    # Cumulative score calculation
    for event_name in event_names:
        cumulative_score += float(event_score)
        team_scores.append(cumulative_score)
```

### Frontend (leaderboard_chart.js)
```javascript
function initTeamProgressChart(chartData) {
    // Enhanced Chart.js configuration
    // - Professional styling
    // - Interactive tooltips
    // - Smooth animations
    // - Responsive design
}
```

### Template (leaderboard.html)
```html
<!-- Enhanced chart section with descriptive text -->
<div class="card-header bg-info text-white">
    <h3>Team Progress Timeline</h3>
    <p>Track how teams have progressed through events over time</p>
</div>
```

## Sample Data Handling
When no real event data exists, the system generates consistent sample data using seeded random numbers based on team codes, ensuring:
- Realistic progression patterns
- Consistent data across page refreshes
- Varying but believable score increments

## Visual Enhancements
1. **Chart Title**: "Team Performance Progress by Event"
2. **Informational Text**: Explains that chart shows cumulative points
3. **Professional Color Scheme**: High contrast colors for accessibility
4. **Enhanced Grid**: Subtle grid lines with professional borders
5. **Better Typography**: Bold labels and proper font sizing

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. Event scores are automatically reflected in the chart
2. Chart updates when new events are scored
3. Colors remain consistent for each team across all views

### For Users
1. Hover over data points to see exact scores
2. Legend shows all active teams with their colors
