# Template Fix for Event Detail Page

## üö® **Problem Fixed**
**Error**: `VariableDoesNotExist at /events/2/ - Failed lookup for key [comments] in 'team_3'`

## üêõ **Root Cause**
The template was trying to access attributes on a team string (like 'team_3') instead of getting the vote object first and then accessing its attributes.

**Incorrect code:**
```django
{{ existing_votes|get_item:team.comments }}
{{ existing_votes|get_item:team.coordination_score }}
```

The issue was that `team` is just a string like 'team_3', not an object with attributes.

## ‚úÖ **Solution Applied**

Changed all instances in `templates/core/event_detail.html` from:
```django
{% if team in existing_votes and existing_votes|get_item:team.coordination_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}
```

To:
```django
{% if team in existing_votes %}{% with existing_votes|get_item:team as vote %}{% if vote.coordination_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}{% endwith %}{% endif %}
```

## üîß **Specific Changes Made**

### 1. **Coordination Score Selection**
```django
# Before (BROKEN)
{% if team in existing_votes and existing_votes|get_item:team.coordination_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}

# After (FIXED)
{% if team in existing_votes %}{% with existing_votes|get_item:team as vote %}{% if vote.coordination_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}{% endwith %}{% endif %}
```

### 2. **Selection Score Selection**
```django
# Before (BROKEN)
{% if team in existing_votes and existing_votes|get_item:team.selection_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}

# After (FIXED)
{% if team in existing_votes %}{% with existing_votes|get_item:team as vote %}{% if vote.selection_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}{% endwith %}{% endif %}
```

### 3. **Overall Score Selection**
```django
# Before (BROKEN)
{% if team in existing_votes and existing_votes|get_item:team.overall_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}

# After (FIXED)
{% if team in existing_votes %}{% with existing_votes|get_item:team as vote %}{% if vote.overall_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}{% endwith %}{% endif %}
```

### 4. **Enjoyment Score Selection**
```django
# Before (BROKEN)
{% if team in existing_votes and existing_votes|get_item:team.enjoyment_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}

# After (FIXED)
{% if team in existing_votes %}{% with existing_votes|get_item:team as vote %}{% if vote.enjoyment_score == forloop.counter %}selected{% endif %}{% endwith %}{% endif %}
```

### 5. **Comments Textarea**
```django
# Before (BROKEN)
{% if team in existing_votes %}{{ existing_votes|get_item:team.comments }}{% endif %}

# After (FIXED)  
{% if team in existing_votes %}{% with existing_votes|get_item:team as vote %}{{ vote.comments }}{% endwith %}{% endif %}
```

## üí° **How the Fix Works**

1. **Get the vote object**: `{% with existing_votes|get_item:team as vote %}`
2. **Access vote attributes**: `vote.coordination_score`, `vote.comments`, etc.
3. **Properly close the with block**: `{% endwith %}`

This way we:
- First get the vote object from the dictionary using the team key
- Then access the attributes on the vote object (not the team string)
- The template logic now works correctly

## üéØ **Result**

- ‚úÖ Event detail page (`/events/<id>/`) now loads without errors
- ‚úÖ Existing votes are properly displayed in the form
- ‚úÖ Vote updates work correctly
- ‚úÖ Comments are pre-filled for existing votes
- ‚úÖ Score dropdowns show previously selected values

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

The events voting system is now fully functional:

1. **Navigate to events**: http://127.0.0.1:8000/events/
2. **Click on an event** to view voting page
3. **Vote for other teams** on 4 criteria (1-10 scale)
4. **View real-time scores** and rankings
5. **Update votes** as needed

The template fix resolves the variable lookup error and the voting system is ready for use!
