## Technical Implementation

### Models Used
- `Player`: Individual treasure hunt scores and team assignments
- `Event`: Competition events (Group Dance, Group Song)
- `EventVote`: Team voting data with criteria-based scoring
- `EventParticipation`: Team participation tracking

### View Logic (apps/core/views.py - LeaderboardView)
```python
# Calculate treasure hunt scores
for player in Player.objects.all():
    team = player.team
    if team in team_data:
        team_data[team]['treasure_hunt_score'] += player.score

# Calculate event scores for each team
active_events = Event.objects.filter(is_active=True)
for event in active_events:
    event_scores = event.average_scores
    for team_code in team_data.keys():
        if team_code in event_scores:
            score = event_scores[team_code]['total']
            team_data[team_code]['event_scores'][event.name] = score
            team_data[team_code]['total_event_score'] += score

# Calculate final total scores
team_data[team_code]['total_score'] = (
    team_data[team_code]['treasure_hunt_score'] + 
    team_data[team_code]['total_event_score']
)
```

### Template Updates (templates/core/leaderboard.html)
- Added `{% load core_extras %}` for dictionary access filters
- Enhanced team cards with score breakdown columns
- Added Events Results section with detailed event scoring
- Updated navigation and call-to-action buttons
