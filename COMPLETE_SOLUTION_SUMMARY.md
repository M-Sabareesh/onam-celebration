## Quick Fixes for Immediate Problems

### Fix Missing Image (IMG_9164.JPG)

**Option 1: Upload Missing File**
```bash
# Upload IMG_9164.JPG to media/question_images/
# Ensure file name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
```

**Option 2: Update Database Reference**
```python
# In Django shell or admin, update the question to use existing image
# Change question_image field to point to existing file like 'Onma5.jpg'
```

**Option 3: Use Existing Image**
```bash
# Copy existing image with new name
cp media/question_images/Onma5.jpg media/question_images/IMG_9164.JPG
```

### Enable Real Google Photos Upload

**Step 1: Google Cloud Console Setup**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create new project or select existing
3. Enable "Photos Library API" 
4. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID credentials
5. Choose "Desktop application" 
6. Download JSON credentials file
7. Save as `google_photos_credentials.json` in project root

**Step 2: Get Album ID**
1. Create Google Photos album: "Onam Celebration - Treasure Hunt Photos"
2. Share album and copy share URL
3. Extract album ID from URL (the part after `/albums/`)
4. Update `.env` file:
```
GOOGLE_PHOTOS_ALBUM_ID=your_actual_album_id_here
```

**Step 3: Test Integration**
```bash
# Check status
python manage.py enable_google_photos --status

# Test upload (requires credentials)
python manage.py enable_google_photos --test
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Image Loading
```bash
# Start development server
./test_server.sh  # Linux/Mac
# or
test_server.bat   # Windows

# Test existing image in browser
http://localhost:8000/media/question_images/Onma5.jpg

# Test missing image (should show 404)
http://localhost:8000/media/question_images/IMG_9164.JPG
```

### Test Google Photos Upload
```bash
# Check current status
python manage.py enable_google_photos --status

# After adding real credentials, test upload
python manage.py enable_google_photos --test
```
