# Image Question Type Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Image Question Type Implementation

The image question type has been successfully implemented in your Onam Django application. Here's what has been added:

### 1. Model Changes ✅
- **TreasureHuntQuestion model** now includes:
  - `question_type` choice: `'image_text'` - "Image Question (Text Answer)"
  - `question_image` field: `ImageField(upload_to='question_images/')`
  - Support for image-based questions where users type their answers

### 2. Admin Interface ✅
- **Image Preview**: Thumbnail preview in question list view
- **Large Image Preview**: Full-size preview when editing questions
- **Upload Support**: Easy image upload through admin interface
- **Question Type Filter**: Filter questions by type including image_text

### 3. Template Implementation ✅
- **Image Display**: Questions with images show the image prominently
- **Answer Input**: Text area for users to type their answers to image questions
- **Custom Template Filter**: `get_item` filter added to access dictionary values
- **Responsive Design**: Images scale properly on different screen sizes

### 4. View Logic ✅
- **Answer Handling**: Image text questions are processed like regular text questions
- **Submission Logic**: Users can submit typed answers for image questions
- **Answer Display**: Shows existing answers for completed image questions

### 5. Template Filter Fix ✅
- **Custom Filter**: Created `apps/core/templatetags/core_extras.py`
- **get_item Filter**: Allows template access to dictionary values by key
- **Template Loading**: Added `{% load core_extras %}` to treasure_hunt.html

Question Type: Image Question (Text Answer)
Image: [Upload image of Onam celebration]
Expected Answer: "Onam"
```

## Technical Implementation Details:

### Database Schema:
```python
class TreasureHuntQuestion(models.Model):
    question_text = models.TextField()
    question_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[
        ('text', 'Text Answer'),
        ('photo', 'Photo Upload'),
        ('multiple_choice', 'Multiple Choice'),
        ('image_text', 'Image Question (Text Answer)'),  # ← New type
    ])
    question_image = models.ImageField(upload_to='question_images/', blank=True, null=True)  # ← New field
    # ... other fields
```

### Template Usage:
```html
{% load core_extras %}

<!-- Display question image if exists -->
{% if question.question_image %}
    <div class="text-center mb-4">
        <img src="{{ question.question_image.url }}" 
             class="img-fluid rounded shadow-lg" 
             style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 400px; object-fit: contain;"
             alt="Question Image">
    </div>
{% endif %}

<!-- Handle image_text question type -->
{% elif question.question_type == 'image_text' %}
    <div class="mb-3">
        <label for="text_answer_{{ question.id }}" class="form-label">
            <i class="fas fa-image me-2"></i>What do you see in the image above?
        </label>
        <textarea class="form-control" name="text_answer" rows="3" 
                  placeholder="Describe what you see or answer the question based on the image..." required></textarea>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="btn btn-success">
