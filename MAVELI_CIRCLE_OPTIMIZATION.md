# Maveli Image Circle Optimization

## Changes Made

### 🎯 **Visual Improvements**

1. **Removed Crown Emoji (👑)** - Eliminated the crown emoji that appeared below the Maveli image
2. **Fitted Image in Circle** - Adjusted Maveli image to fit perfectly within the circular container
3. **Removed External Text** - Removed title and decorative elements that extended outside the circle
4. **Added object-fit: cover** - Ensures the image scales properly within the circular boundary

### 📐 **Size Adjustments**

**Image Size:**
- **Previous:** 440px × 440px (extended outside the 500px container)
- **New:** 400px × 400px (fits perfectly within the 500px container with proper padding)

**Container:** 500px × 500px (unchanged)
**Padding:** ~50px margin inside the container for proper visual spacing

### 🎨 **Visual Design**

#### Before:
- Maveli image at 440px (too large for container)
- Crown emoji below the image
- Text labels extending outside the circle
- Elements overlapping the golden gradient background

#### After:
- Maveli image at 400px (perfectly contained)
- Clean circular design with no external elements
- Image uses `object-fit: cover` for optimal scaling
- All visual elements contained within the golden circle

### 📱 **Responsive Design Updated**

**Desktop (≥768px):** 400px × 400px  
**Tablets (≤768px):** 240px × 240px  
**Mobile (≤576px):** 200px × 200px  

### 🛠️ **Technical Changes**

### 🎯 **Result**

**Clean Circular Design:**

4. **Enhanced Focus** - Maveli image is the star without distractions

### 📋 **CSS Properties Added**

This ensures the Maveli image scales to cover the entire circular area while maintaining its aspect ratio and not distorting.

### ✅ **Benefits**
