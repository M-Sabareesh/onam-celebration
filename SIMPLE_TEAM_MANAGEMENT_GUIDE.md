- **Keep teams "Active"** - So they appear on the site
- **Use memorable names** - Make them fun and engaging

#### ❌ Don't Do This:
- **Don't change "Team code"** - This breaks the system
- **Don't delete teams** - This will lose player data
- **Don't deactivate teams** - Unless you want to hide them

### 🧪 Test Your Changes

1. **Change a team name** in admin
2. **Go to leaderboard**: `/leaderboard/`
3. **Check the chart** - New name should appear in legend
4. **Look at team standings** - New name should be displayed

### 🔧 Setup Script (If Teams Don't Exist)

If you don't see "Team configurations" in admin, run this:

```bash
python simple_team_management.py
```

This will:
- Create the team management table
- Set up default teams
- Test the integration

### 📊 What About "Team Event Participations"?

This is a **different, more complex feature** for tracking individual player participation in team events. **You don't need this for basic team name management.**

- **Team configurations** = Simple team name management ✅
- **Team event participations** = Advanced event tracking (optional)

### 🚨 Troubleshooting

#### Problem: Don't see "Team configurations" in admin
**Solution**: Run the production fix script to create the tables:
```bash
python complete_production_fix.py
```

#### Problem: Changes don't appear on site
**Solution**: 
1. Check that you saved the changes in admin
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+F5)
3. Make sure the team is marked as "Active"

#### Problem: Chart colors don't match team names
**Solution**: The chart automatically assigns colors. Team names change but colors stay consistent for each team position.
