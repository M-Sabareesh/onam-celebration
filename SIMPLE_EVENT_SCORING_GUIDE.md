   - Choose the team to award points to
   - Enter the points (0-100+ range)
   - Select event type:
     - **Team**: Standard team event
     - **Individual**: Individual competition
     - **Hybrid**: Team event with individual participants
   - For hybrid events, select individual participants
   - Add optional notes
   - Click "Award Points"

3. **Manage Scores**

   - Delete scores using the delete button
   - Edit scores through Django admin

### Event Type Guidelines

1. **Team Events** (e.g., Group Dance, Drama)
   - Select "Team Event"
   - Points awarded to entire team
   - No individual participant selection needed

2. **Individual Events** (e.g., Singing Contest, Solo Performance)
   - Select "Individual Event"
   - Points recorded for the individual but associated with their team
   - No participant selection needed

3. **Hybrid Events** (e.g., Team Drama with Individual Roles)
   - Select "Hybrid (Team with Individual Participants)"
   - Award points to the team
   - Select specific participants who contributed
   - Points distributed among participants

## Integration with Existing System

### Team Management
- Uses existing `TeamConfiguration` model
- Team names are pulled from admin-managed team configurations
- Supports custom team names set by administrators

### Player System
- Integrates with existing `Player` model
- Participant selection filtered by team and active status
- For hybrid events, points can be distributed to individual players

### Leaderboard
- New scores will be reflected in leaderboard calculations
- Team totals include simple event scores
- Individual participant scores updated for hybrid events

## Database Schema

```sql
-- SimpleEventScore table
CREATE TABLE core_simpleeventcore (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id BIGINT REFERENCES core_event(id),
    team VARCHAR(20),
    event_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'team',
    points DECIMAL(6,2) DEFAULT 0,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(event_id, team)
);

-- Many-to-many for participants
CREATE TABLE core_simpleeventcore_participants (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    simpleeventcore_id BIGINT REFERENCES core_simpleeventcore(id),
    player_id BIGINT REFERENCES core_player(id)
);
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Set Up Teams** (if not already done)
   - Access `/team-management/` or Django admin
   - Ensure team configurations exist

3. **Create Events** (if needed)
   - Use Django admin to create events
   - Set appropriate participation types

4. **Start Scoring**
   - Access `/admin/simple-scoring/`
   - Begin awarding points to teams

## Benefits

### For Administrators

- **Quick Scoring**: Just select event, team, and points
- **Flexible**: Supports all event types (team, individual, hybrid)
- **No Attribution Required**: No need to specify who awarded the score
- **Visual Feedback**: Recent scores displayed immediately

### For the System
- **Clean Data Model**: Simple, focused on core functionality
- **Integration Ready**: Works with existing team and player systems
- **Audit Trail**: Timestamps and notes for tracking
- **Scalable**: Can handle any number of events and teams

## Next Steps

1. **Test the Interface**: Access `/admin/simple-scoring/` and test scoring
2. **Verify Leaderboard**: Check that scores appear in `/leaderboard/`
3. **Train Admins**: Show administrators the simple workflow
4. **Monitor Usage**: Watch for any issues or feedback

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Migration Error**: Run `python manage.py migrate` to create tables
- **Access Denied**: Ensure user has staff/admin permissions
- **No Events**: Create events in Django admin first
- **No Teams**: Set up team configurations
