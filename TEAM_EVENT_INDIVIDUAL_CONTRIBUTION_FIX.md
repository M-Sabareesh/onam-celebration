# Team Event Individual Contribution Fix

## Problem Description

**Issue:** Players who participate in team events were not getting individual credit for their contributions. Only the team total was recorded, but individual player scores did not reflect their participation in team events.

**Example Scenario:**
- Team A wins a team event and gets 100 points
- 5 players from Team A participated in the event
- Previously: Team gets 100 points, but individual players get 0 points
- **Fixed:** Team gets 100 points, each participating player gets 20 points (100÷5)

## Solution Implemented

### 🔧 **Model Updates**

#### 1. Enhanced EventScore Model
- **Added:** `update_participant_scores()` method
- **Added:** `update_single_player_score()` method  
- **Enhanced:** `save()` method to trigger score updates

#### 2. Enhanced TeamEventParticipation Model
- **Added:** `save()` method to update scores when participation changes
- **Added:** `delete()` method to update scores when participation is removed

#### 3. Enhanced IndividualEventScore Model
- **Updated:** `update_player_score()` to include team event contributions

### ⚙️ **Logic Changes**

#### Team Event Score Distribution:
```python
# When a team event is scored:
team_total_points = 100
participating_players = 5
individual_contribution = team_total_points / participating_players = 20 points per player
```

#### Player Score Calculation:
```python
player_total_score = treasure_hunt_score + individual_events_score + team_events_contribution
```

#### Team Event Contribution Calculation:
```python
team_events_contribution = sum(team_event_points / participants_count for each participated event)
```

## Features Added

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Team Dance Competition
- **Event:** Team Dance Competition
- **Team A Score:** 80 points  
- **Participants:** Alice, Bob, Charlie (3 players)
- **Result:**
  - Team A total: 80 points
  - Alice individual: +26.67 points
  - Bob individual: +26.67 points  
  - Charlie individual: +26.67 points

### Scenario 2: Mixed Event Participation
- **Player:** Priya
- **Scores:**
  - Treasure Hunt: 45 points
  - Individual Singing: 25 points
  - Team Drama (4 participants): 60 ÷ 4 = 15 points
  - Team Sports (6 participants): 90 ÷ 6 = 15 points
- **Total Individual Score:** 45 + 25 + 15 + 15 = **100 points**
