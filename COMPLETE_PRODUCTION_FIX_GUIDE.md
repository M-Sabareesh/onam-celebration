### Manual Steps (If Scripts Don't Work)
python manage.py shell -c "
from apps.core.models import Player, Event, EventScore, TeamConfiguration
import random

# Create teams
teams = [('team_1', 'Red Warriors'), ('team_2', 'Blue Champions'), ('team_3', 'Green Masters'), ('team_4', 'Yellow Legends')]
for code, name in teams:
    TeamConfiguration.objects.get_or_create(team_code=code, defaults={'team_name': name})

# Create players
players = [('Arjun', 'team_1'), ('Priya', 'team_2'), ('Ravi', 'team_3'), ('Sita', 'team_4')]
for name, team in players:
    Player.objects.get_or_create(name=name, defaults={'team': team, 'score': random.randint(50, 150)})

# Create events
events = [('Dance Competition', 'team'), ('Singing Contest', 'individual'), ('Drama Performance', 'team')]
for title, event_type in events:
    Event.objects.get_or_create(title=title, defaults={'event_type': event_type, 'is_active': True})

# Create scores for graph
for event in Event.objects.all():
    for team_code, _ in teams:
        EventScore.objects.get_or_create(event=event, team=team_code, defaults={'score': random.randint(60, 95)})

print('Sample data created!')

# 3. Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### What This Fixes

- Creates missing `django_session` table
- Applies all Django core migrations
- Fixes the site crash issue

#### 2. **Empty Graph Issue** ✅
- Creates sample events and scores
- Provides data for the chart to display
- Sets up proper team progress tracking

#### 3. **Team Management** ✅
- Creates `TeamConfiguration` model for admin management
- Allows changing team names through admin panel
- Updates team names throughout the site instantly

### Team Name Management (After Fix)

Once your site is working, you have **simple and clear team management**:

#### 🏆 Access Team Management
1. Go to: `https://your-site.com/admin/`
2. Login with superuser credentials
3. Look for **"CORE"** section  
4. Click **"Team configurations"** ← This is your Team table!

#### ✏️ Change Team Names (Super Simple)
1. **Click on any team** (e.g., "team_1: Team 1")
2. **Edit the "Team name" field**:
   - "Team 1" → "Red Warriors" 
   - "Team 2" → "Blue Champions"
   - "Team 3" → "Maveli Squad"
   - "Team 4" → "Onam Heroes"
3. **Click "Save"**
4. **Done!** New name appears instantly everywhere
