# ADMIN EVENT SCORING SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE

## Overview
Comprehensive admin interface for creating events and awarding points directly to teams, with automatic leaderboard integration.

## Features Implemented

### 1. EventScore Model (`apps/core/models.py`)

class EventScore(models.Model):
    """Admin-awarded scores for events"""
    event = models.ForeignKey(Event, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    team = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=Player.TEAM_CHOICES)
    points = models.DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2, default=0)
    notes = models.TextField(blank=True)
    awarded_by = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    awarded_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

### For Users

#### Leaderboard Integration
- Team standings show combined treasure hunt + event scores
- Event-specific results section displays all event scores
- Score breakdown shows treasure hunt vs event points
- Real-time updates when admin awards points

## Technical Implementation

### Score Priority Logic
```python
# In Event.average_scores property
admin_score = EventScore.objects.get(event=self, team=team_code).points
voting_score = calculate_voting_average()

# Admin score takes priority
final_score = admin_score if admin_score > 0 else voting_score
```

### Leaderboard Integration
```python
# In LeaderboardView
for event in active_events:
    event_scores = event.average_scores  # Uses admin scores if available
    team_data[team_code]['event_scores'][event.name] = score
    team_data[team_code]['total_event_score'] += score

# Final total
team_data[team_code]['total_score'] = (
    treasure_hunt_score + total_event_score
)
```

### Database Structure
```sql
-- EventScore table
CREATE TABLE core_eventscore (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id INTEGER REFERENCES core_event(id),
    team VARCHAR(20),
    points DECIMAL(5,2),
    notes TEXT,
    awarded_by VARCHAR(100),
    awarded_at TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(event_id, team)
);
```

## Admin Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Group Dance Competition
```
1. Create Event:
   - Name: "Group Dance Competition"
   - Type: "Group Dance" 
   - Voting: Disabled (admin will score directly)

2. Add Teams:
   - Add all 4 teams to the event

3. Award Points After Performance:
   - Team 1: 8.5 points - "Excellent coordination"
   - Team 2: 7.8 points - "Good performance, minor timing issues"
   - Team 3: 9.2 points - "Outstanding synchronization"
   - Team 4: 8.0 points - "Creative choreography"

4. Results:
   - Automatically appear in leaderboard
   - Teams ranked by combined treasure hunt + event scores
```

### Example 2: Cultural Event with Voting
```
1. Create Event:
   - Name: "Cultural Performance"
   - Type: "Group Dance"
   - Voting: Enabled (teams vote for each other)

2. During Event:
   - Teams vote using existing voting system
   - Average scores calculated automatically

3. Admin Override (if needed):
   - Admin can award official scores
   - Admin scores override voting results
   - Maintains transparency with notes
```
